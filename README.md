Base32Encoder is a pure Swift library that encodes Data to a Base32 String

## About
Encodes data as per the [RFC 3548] specification for Base32 data encodings.  

This library was written for a project that required encoding of *small* data packets and to learn *bit bashing*.  This means the code is written for learning and has not been optimized for elegance or performance.

## Installation

### Carthage
Simply add the requirement to your Cartfile:
`github "markrenaud/Base32Encoder"`

### Manually
Copy `Base32.swift` to your project

## Usage

If the Base32Encoder was installed as a library, you must import it (this can be skipped if it was manually added to your project).
`import import Base32Encoder`

You can then encode data and (optionally pad as per [RFC 3548 2.2 - Padding of encoded data](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3548#section-2.2)
```swift
let data = "hi".data(using: .ascii)!
let base32 = Base32.encode(data: data) // = "NBUQ"
let base32padded = Base32.encode(data: data, padding: true) // = "NBUQ===="
```
Or you can use the Data extension
```swift
let base32 = data.base32String(padded: true) // = "NBUQ===="
```
